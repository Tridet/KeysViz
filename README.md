# KeysViz Project

This repository hosts the KeysViz project motivated by the [interactive data visualization class](https://github.com/LyonDataViz/MOS5.5-Dataviz) given by [Romain Vuillemot](https://github.com/romsson), during my last year at École Centrale de Lyon.

# Record your own keystrokes and analyze it

This project aims at creating different D3js visualizations showing insights from personal keyboard strokes data. For this purpose a keylogger has been implemented.

The project is available [here](https://tridet.github.io/KeysViz/index.html).

# Try it

## 1. Install the keylogger and record keystrokes

You can choose to launch and stop the keylogger at anytime hence avoiding to record sensitive personal data such as passwords. To install the keylogger use the README.md file inside the keylogger folder.

## 2. Load your personal logs


## 3. Visualize the insights
