# KeysViz Project

This repository hosts the KeyViz project motivated by the [interactive data visualization class](https://github.com/LyonDataViz/MOS5.5-Dataviz) given by [Romain Vuillemot](https://github.com/romsson), during my last year at École Centrale de Lyon.

This project aims at creating different D3js visualizations showing personnal key strokes data. For this purpose a keylogger has been implemented.
